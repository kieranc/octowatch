#Octowatch
Use your Pebble watch to monitor (and eventually, control) 3D printers that use the excellent [Octoprint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint) host software.

This is a fork adapted to work with the current -devel branch of OctoPrint, version 1.2.0.
I've added reading of temperatures and updated the API calls to work with the new version.


The original repo is at (https://github.com/jjg/octowatch/) if you're looking for documentation etc
